# Dark Mode Project

This project was a simple exploration in how to set up dark mode functionality.

## What I learned
I learned about how to utilize a data class on the document element in order to change CSS Variable values according to whether light or dark mode is enabled.

Learning this also beckoned me into learning more about color theory and design and how to utilize Primary and Secondary colors and how to change these according to whether the page is in Light or Dark Mode.

I also decided to learn about Local Storage API so that the page would "remember" what mode it is in when revisited.
